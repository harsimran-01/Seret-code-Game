Welcome to the Code Encoder and Decoder in Python! This program allows you to encode or decode your input code based on simple algorithms.

How to Use:

You can choose whether you want to "ENCODE" or "DECODE" your code.
If you choose "ENCODE", the program will encode your input code using a specific algorithm. If you choose "DECODE", it will decode the input code.
Enter your code when prompted, and the program will perform the respective action.
The encoded or decoded code will be displayed.
Python Code Explanation:

The program first defines a list of lowercase alphabets.
It then generates six random alphabets, which will be appended to the input code during encoding.
Two functions, for_encode and for_decode, handle the encoding and decoding logic.
The encoding algorithm:
For input codes with more than three characters, it removes the first character and appends it to the end.
Six random alphabets are added to the beginning and end of the processed string.
The final encoded code is returned.
For input codes with three or fewer characters, it simply reverses the input string.
The decoding algorithm:
For input codes with more than three characters, it removes the last three characters and the first three characters.
The last character is then appended to the beginning of the remaining characters.
The final decoded code is returned.
For input codes with three or fewer characters, it simply reverses the input string.
The user is prompted to enter their code and choose the encoding or decoding action.
The corresponding function is called, and the result is displayed.
